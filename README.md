Welcome to the Rummy Card Game application, a dynamic project crafted with JavaFX, JDBC, and JavaRMI, seamlessly orchestrated and built with Maven. The application is modularized into three components:
1.	Rummy-server:
 
      This module houses the server-side code, orchestrating the game logic and ensuring a smooth gameplay experience. It serves as the backbone, managing game sessions and facilitating communication between players.
2.	Rummy-shared:
  
      This module bridges communication between the client and server. It enables the seamless exchange of messages.
3.	Rummy-ui:
 
      The client-side and UI module provide an engaging interface for players. Written in JavaFX, it offers an intuitive and visually appealing platform.
